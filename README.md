## üëã Hi, I'm Brian!

I am a software engineer and security researcher who works on many different projects, ranging from reverse engineering software to developing web interfaces! While many of my projects are private, I occasionally publish software that helps me in my day to day tasks:

- ü§ñ **[FBTM](https://github.com/brxxn/fbtm):** Analyzes Meta's binary transparency archives to extract key data (like internal API endpoints and GraphQL operations) from JavaScript bundles and compares it with previous ones to identify new features for testing. It is managed by a [GitHub action](https://github.com/brxxn/fbtm-action) that allows anyone to use it by simply creating an issue and having it approved by a maintainer.
- üåé **[Jumpstarter](https://github.com/brxxn/jumpstarter)**: Enables remote access to local services when port forwarding is unavailable (such as when an ISP uses CGNAT IPv4) by hosting a Discord bot that can start an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) instance.
- ‚òïÔ∏è **[jdcli](https://github.com/brxxn/jdcli)**: Command line interface that allows extraction and multithreaded optimistic decompiling of .jar files, enabling the decompiling of certain jar files even if the decompiler hangs or deadlocks attempting to decompile it.
- üõú **[mitmproxy](https://github.com/brxxn/mitmproxy)**: Custom fork of the [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/) project that includes an additional addon and web management interface for automatic rules to change request and response content, reducing the number of scripts I need to write to modify requests automatically.

You may also notice that I have a Security Bug Bounty Hunter badge on my GitHub profile, which I have obtained from finding and reporting vulnerabilities to GitHub through their [bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com). I also participate in bug bounty programs for other products as well, including Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft, Discord, and Apple!
