## 👋 Hi, I'm Brian!

I am a software engineer and security researcher who works on projects ranging from reverse engineering software to web interfaces that help me work faster. Here are some of my public projects:

- 🤖 **[FBTM](https://github.com/brxxn/fbtm):** Analyzes Meta's binary transparency archives to extract key data (like internal API endpoints and GraphQL operations) from JavaScript bundles and compares it with previous ones to identify new features, automated by a [custom GitHub action](https://github.com/brxxn/fbtm-action).
- 🌎 **[Jumpstarter](https://github.com/brxxn/jumpstarter)**: Enables remote access to local services when port forwarding is unavailable by hosting a Discord bot that can start an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) instance.
- ☕️ **[jdcli](https://github.com/brxxn/jdcli)**: Command line interface that allows extraction and multithreaded optimistic decompiling of .jar files, allowing large projects which contain classes that cause the decompiler to hang or deadlock to be analyzed.
- 🛜 **[mitmproxy](https://github.com/brxxn/mitmproxy)**: Custom fork of the [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/) project that includes a web management interface to modify automatic request/response rules without the need to write a script.

I also find and report security vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs in major products, including GitHub, macOS, Facebook, Instagram, and Microsoft.
